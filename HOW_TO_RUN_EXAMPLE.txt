1. Test the pipeline.

The package provides a small example dataset for testing the pipeline. The
dataset is for Aradidopsis, chromosome 1. To run the example, first change
directory to the example folder:

    cd example

Then open the config.example file, change the PIPELINE_PATH to the path where
you put the miR-PREFeR package folder. For example, if you put miR-PREFeR at
~/tools/miR-PREFeR, then set PIPELINE_PATH as:

    PIPELINE_PATH=~/tools/miR-PREFeR

Save the config.example file. In the example folder, execute command:

    python ../miR_PREFeR.py -l -k pipeline config.example

The -l option generates a log file in the output directory example-result. The
-k option keeps the temp directory used to store the intermediate files. The
temp directory is in the example-result directory.

If you have python, samtools, RNALfold installed and in the PATH, you should be
able to run the test program. It takes about one or two minutes to
finish. You'll be able to see the result in the example-result folder.



================================================================================
2. Test how to do checkpointing.

Before testing this, if you have run the pipeline with the example.config file
in this folder, please remove the example-result folder first.

First run the pipeline with 'pipeline' command:

    python ../miR_PREFeR.py -l -k pipeline config.example

After running for a while (20 seconds, for example. You should let it run for
enough time to do at least one checkpoint. A "Done" is shown when a checkpoint
is applied), kill the process by "Ctrl-C". To check where the pipeline was stopped,
run:

    python ../miR_PREFeR.py -l check config.example

This will show the checkpoint information.

To restart the pipeline from where it was stopped, run:

    python ../miR_PREFeR.py -l recover config.example

The pipeline will continue to finish the job specified in the config.example
file.
