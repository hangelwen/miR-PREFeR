This FAQ contains some general or specific questions about executing miR-PREFeR
in command-line mode. You need to type all the commands in a terminal
(e.g. under UNIX, Linux, MAC etc.).

Q: How do I know whether I can run python scripts on my machine?
A: Type "python --version". You should see the version number.

Q: How do I know whether the Vienna package has been correctly installed on my
machine?
A: Go to the folder where you installed the package,
e.g. ViennaRNA-2.1.2. Go the sub-folder Progs by typing "cd Progs". Execute
command "./RNALfold -h". A successfully installed RNALfold program will output
options/parameters and their explanations.

Q: How do I know I have added the ViennaRNA package to the PATH environment
variable correctly?
A: If the executables of ViennaRNA package have been
correctly added to PATH, you can execute RNALfold program from any
directory. For example, even if you are not in "..../ViennaRNA-2.1.2/Progs", you
can still type "RNALfold -h" and get the helpful information for this
program. On the other hand, if you can execute RNALfold in
".../ViennaRNA-2.2.2/Progs" but get the otuput similar to "RNALfold: command not
found" in other directories, you did not add the ViennaRNA package to PATH
correctly.

Q: How do I add the executables of the ViennaRNA package to PATH?
A: A comprehensive introduction to this topic for all types of shell can be
found at http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-adding-path/ or just google
"add directory to PATH". Suppose you use bash, you can use the following
commands to check and modify PATH.  To check the contents of PATH, type "echo
$PATH".  To add a directory such as "/Users/xyz/ViennaRNA-2.2.2/Progs" to PATH,
use "export PATH="$PATH:/Users/xyz/ViennaRNA-2.2.2/Progs".  The above command
will only work for the current terminal. To make the change to PATH permanent,
you need to modify "~/.bash_profile". One possible command to do so is to type:
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/Users/xyz/ViennaRNA-2.2.2/Progs' >>
~/.bash_profile". You can also use editors such as emacs to directly change
~/.bash_profile.  Finally, use "echo $PATH" again to check whether the new
directly has been added to PATH correctly.

Q: How to decompress *.tar.gz (ViennaRNA package) and *.tar.bz2 (samtools)?
A: Type "tar xvf ViennaRNA-2.2.2.tar.gz" and "tar jfx samtools-x.x.x.tar.bz2",
respectively.

Q: How to install samtools?
A: After decompressing samtools using "tar jfx" (if in tar.bz2 format), execute
"make".

Q: How do I know that I have intalled samtools correctly?
A: You should see an executable file named "samtools". Type "samtools". You will
see version number and the usage information. Because miR-PREFeR uses "samtools
depth", "samtools view", and "samtools faidx" commands, you need to check
whether these comamnds exist.

Q: I cannot install ViennaRNA package.
A: If your OS is relatively old, consider to use an earlier version of ViennaRNA
package. If your OS is new, consider to install a newer version.
